**Electiva - Online Voting Android Application**

Electiva is an Android application designed to facilitate online voting. It offers a secure and efficient platform for conducting elections with separate modules for administrators and users (voters/candidates). The application is built using Dart for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

Key Features:

Administrator Module:

The administrator has exclusive control over candidate and voter registration.
Admins cannot cast votes to ensure impartiality and fairness.
Admins can initiate and conclude elections.
Users (Voters/Candidates) Module:

Users (candidates and voters) must be registered by the administrator.
Each individual can cast only one vote to prevent duplicate voting.
Secure login using OTP sent to registered email addresses.
Election Management:

The system allows the administrator to manage the list of candidates and voters.
Live vote counting is concealed to maintain confidentiality.
Once the election concludes, the system automatically publishes the results anonymously.
